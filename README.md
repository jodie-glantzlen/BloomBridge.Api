# BloomBridge 

Bloombridge is a little wellbeing app that matches suspiciously named users with equally suspiciously named therapists, based on personal needs and expertise.

Tech stack:
- .NET 8 for the backend  
- SQLite database  
- React Native for the frontend (coming soon!) 


*Built in C# to keep me sharp ðŸ¤“ and sane (although not guaranteed after that pun) while job hunting in Amsterdam, my new home.*
